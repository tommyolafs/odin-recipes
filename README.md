# odin-recipes

In this project I will showcase my skills in creating a multiple webpages using
HTML with links between them to form a website. My Git skills will be used in the
creating of the repository, committing, pushing, etc. This project also is mostly
navigated through the command line.

As I continue with this project I show off some CSS skills to style the
previously HTML-only website and make it a bit easier on the eyes.
